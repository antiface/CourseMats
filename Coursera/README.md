Coursera Courses
================
This repository is meant to contain experiments, mostly in Python, that I hope will show some of the underlying basic concepts of computer science that I have learned taking so many Coursera courses over the years. You unfortunately will not find any solutions to programming assignments or anything of the kind. What I hope you will find, however, are Python experiments that help teach the underlying concepts of all programming languages, and some more "abstract" concepts of theoretical computer science in (general).
