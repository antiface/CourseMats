Mathematical Thinking
=====================
* There is much that I want to say about Mathematics in general, and the act of learning mathematics in the particular.
* First, I will begin with a short exercise: I will try to treat a single concept and do it as though I were teaching a five-year old about this concept.
* The concept I have chosen for this is the concept of Limit.
